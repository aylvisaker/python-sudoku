# python-sudoku

## sudoku.py
Simple fast sudoku solver. Employs depth-first search to find a solution (indeed, any solution) to the given puzzle. Capable of working on puzzles with linear dimension 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc. (will need to switch to integers for anything larger than 49 as can be found [http://sudokugeant.cabanova.fr/](here)).

## logic.py
Work in progress. Uses the same techniques a human with a pen would use. Eventually this will be used to rate sudoku puzzles.

## n-doku.py
Work in progress. Contains code that will eventually generate puzzles of any dimension.
